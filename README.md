## Spotify Stats
Apats is a React.js and Ruby On Rails app for tracking user listening stats, and history. This project was built by [Hagay Haut](https://github.com/HagayHaut), [Brad Bieselin](https://github.com/bradbieselin), and [Max Murphy](https://github.com/murphy-mi) as the final project for Phase 4 of Flatiron School Software Engineering program. 

## Spotify Web API
This project would not be possible without the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/), which allows third party applications  access user information with user permissions. User information is securely handled following OAuth2.0 protocols. 

## Authentication/Authorization
